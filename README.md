## 👋 Hi there

I am a Ph.D student at School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Chao Sun.

My previous research focused on Roadside / Vehicle-side / Collaborative / Embodied 3D Perception, aiming to enhance the cross-domain spatial understanding of heterogeneous agents.

My current research interests are in the **Spatial Intelligence** and **VLA/World Models**.

More specifically:

- Representation Alignment in VLA Models

- Reinforcement Learning in World Simulator

- Latent Driving World Models
