## 👋 Hi there

I am a Ph.D student at Beijing Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Chao Sun. I earned my bachelor’s degree from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2022.

My previous research focused on roadside / vehicle-side / collaborative / embodied 3D perception, aiming to enhance agents’ spatial awareness for surrounding environment. I have been fortunate to collaborate with X-Humanoid.

Currently my research interests lie in developing autonomous systems through spatial intelligence, generative models and reinforcement learning.

My research interests include:

- Representation Learning and Spatial Alignment

- Reinforcement Learning with World Simulator

- VLA / VA / World Models in Autonomous System
