## 👋 Hi there

🎓 I am a Ph.D student at School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Chao Sun.

🔥 My previous research focused on Roadside / Vehicle-side / Collaborative / Embodied 3D Perception, aiming to enhance the cross-domain spatial understanding of heterogeneous agents.

✨ My currently research interests are in the **End-to-End Autonomous Driving**.

🤗 More specifically, my research interests include:

- Bridging Perception to Action Space in Supervised Fine-Tuning

- Reinforcement Learning and Fine-Tuning in World Simulator

- End-to-End Vision-Language-Action-World Models
