## Hi there 👋

🎓 I am a Ph.D student at School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Chao Sun.

🔥 My previous research focused on Roadside / Vehicle-side / Collaborative / Embodied 3D Perception, aiming to enhance agents’ spatial understanding of surrounding environment.

✨ My currently research interests are in the **Spatial Intelligence** and **Autonomous Driving**.

🤗 More specifically, my research interests include:

- End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Vision-Language-Action-World Models

- Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving

📫 If you are interested in academic collaboration, feel free to reach me via zhangzhang00@bit.edu.cn — I’d love to connect 🤗!
