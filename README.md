## 👋 Hi there

🎓 I am a Ph.D student at School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Chao Sun.

🔥 My previous research focused on Roadside / Vehicle-side / Collaborative / Embodied 3D Perception, aiming to enhance agents’ spatial understanding of surrounding environment.

✨ My currently research interests are in the **Spatial Intelligence** and **End-to-End Autonomous Driving**.

🤗 More specifically, my research interests include:

- Spatial Reasoning Multi-modal Large Language Driving Models

- Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Autonomous Driving Large Models

- Vision-Language-Action-World Models in End-to-End Autonomous Driving
